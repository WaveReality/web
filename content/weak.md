The weak force seems to be intimately tied up with the internal dynamics of [[stochastic particles]], in relationship with the [[spin]] property, for example in the case of the [[neutrino]], which only interacts via the weak force, and can be thought of as a "pure spin" particle.

It is also intimately connected with the _flavors_ or _generations_ of particles, e.g., muon and tau [[leptons]] in addition to the [[electron]], and is what allows the muon or tau to decay into an electron.

It has a very short interaction range, on the scale of a proton charge radius ($10^-15$m), as predicted by the massive nature of the force carriers, the **W** and **Z** bosons. Given that these are massive particles, the same arguments about [[photons]] just being synonymous with the [[Maxwell]] wave functions do not apply.
