**Spin** is a uniquely quantum property that lies at the heart of the underlying mechanisms implemented in the current model. There are two known values of spin, 1 and +/- 1/2:

* [[Bosons]] are nominally the particles that carry force fields, and they have a spin of 1, with the [[photon]] being the canonical example. A spin of 1 is effectively like a spin of 0: in a very abstract sense, they complete a full revolution every "step". It is unclear whether a boson is actually a thing or not under the current model, as the [[photon]] may not really exist, and the weak and strong charge carriers may be something else entirely.

* [[Fermions]] are massive particles like [[electron]]s and [[quark]]s, with a spin of +/- 1/2. Interestingly, the mysterious [[neutrino]] can be thought of as a particle that _only_ has spin and nothing else (no charge) -- it also has a spin of 1/2, but the "matter" neutrino is _always_ spinning in the left-hand direction, while the "antimatter" anti-neutrino spins in the left-hand direction. Although they are thought to have mass, it is possible that neutrinos have these fixed spin directions because they move at the speed of light in a kind of fixed helical pattern in relation to their spin, and they don't have a proper mass-like momentum property after all.

The [[Dirac]] equation introduced "Dirac spinors" as a mathematical formulation of spin for describing the spin 1/2 property of fermions.

In general, the spin of something like an electron is thought to be a strongly [[contextual]] property, meaning that it is easily shaped through interactions with the environment, and is not something that is otherwise strongly constrained by the intrinsic properties of the particle (except for neutrinos).

## Spin as particle momentum and mass mechanism

Under the current [[stochastic particles]] plans, the phenomenon of spin reflects an internal dynamic process within discrete particles, operating over internal state values (similar to the spinors), that is responsible for the following particle properties:

* Maintaining the particle's momentum value across time and space.
* Causing a massive particle to have a resting mass / energy.
* And, of course, its actual spin direction.

The [[neutrino]] is a particle that _only_ has spin, indicating that this spin mechanism can dissociate from other particle properties. Thus, modeling this most mysterious of particles is a first-order goal, along with that of the [[electron]].

The neutrino interacts only via the [[weak]] force, which is strongly localized to around $10^−16$m --- on the scale of the charge radius of a proton ($10^-15$m). This length scale is short because the [[boson]]s that carry the weak force are _massive_ (indeed they are much heavier than the mass of a proton).

The weak force is thus the obvious force for understanding dynamics within fermion particles. In particular, the [[lepton]]s (electron, muon, tau) are all different _flavors_ or _generations_ of the same particle, and the muon and tau decay back to the stable electron through the weak force, while emitting neutrinos (and energy in the form of photons??). Thus, it is clear that the weak force is somehow critically involved in these spin dynamics, which in turn are involved in the increased masses of these higher generation particle variants.

There are 3 different generations (flavors) of quark, analogous to those of the leptons, with up and down being the first generation.

Thus, it makes sense to think of these generations as essentially excited states of some kind of internal spin-like dynamic, which are unstable, and decay back to the stable ground states, while shedding extra spin in the form of neutrinos, which are emitted with zero-sum spin, in the form of a neutrino and an anti-neutrino. So it isn't like there is extra _net_ spin, but somehow the internal spin dynamics are excited, as if there is just more of something spin-like in there.

The property of **weak isospin** is effectively like the charge value that drives the weak force, coming in positive and negative 1/2 increments.

The charged **W** boson is unstable and decays into an electron and a neutrino, so it can be thought of as a kind of anomolous excitation of this weak-spin system, with the extra spin component of the neutrino added to that of the electron.

The neutral **Z** boson is characterized by a weak charge value that is also a function of the momentum of the relevant particles, therefore supporting the connection between spin, momentum, and the weak force.

The masses of these weak bosons is all tied up with the Higgs mechanism, so that also needs to be understood.

Basically, the whole electroweak / spin soup needs to be probed to understand how an elementary particle like the [[electron]] actually works. It seems clear given the mutation rules that an electron is not really _elementary_ anymore: the elementary components are _spin_ and _charge_ and some kinds of interesting dynamics that make these all produce the relevant particle-like behavior.

This all seems like an interesting case where adding more complexity to the model may indeed make it easier to solve, because it gives us a lot of constraints on understanding the connections among charge and spin dynamics.
