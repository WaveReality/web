**Configuration space** is a critical but perhaps generally underappreciated element of standard quantum mechanics, in most of its various formulations (e.g., in the [[Hilbert space]] formulation). It is the space defined by the **multiparticle** configuration of all the elements of relevance to a given experimental setup being analyzed.

Because it describes the _configuration_ of these elements, it is **exponential** in size, with a different space corresponding to each combination of such elements, and manifestly [[non-local]]. Thus, it is an entirely implausible, highly problematic element of standard quantum mechanical approaches.

The need for configuration space at a mathematically deep level arises because the equations being used are _linear_, so they cannot represent any kind of actual interaction among different particles. Without configuration space, every particle would fully superpose on every other particle --- they would just slip on past each other. This is in fact how _bosons_ (e.g., _photons_) behave, but not how _fermions_ like [[electrons]] behave.

The [[pilot-wave]] approach has been (perhaps unfairly) criticized for using configuration space, because it posits that the wave function is actually a "real" thing, thus exposing the implausibility of this otherwise purely [[tools vs models|calculational tool]]. See [[@NorsenMarianOriols15]] for an analysis of the contributions of configuration space to the pilot-wave results.

However, if the underlying dynamics of the system are _nonlinear_, and in particular involve interactions between [[stochastic particles]] and wave functions, then it is possible that these nonlinear interactions end up producing all of the relevant dynamics that are otherwise captured via the configuration space calculational tool. This is the approach taken here.
