The **electron** is the most basic version of a fermion (spin 1/2), and is the focus of the modeling work here. We attempt to model it using the principles of [[stochastic particles]], as it couples with the [[Maxwell]] EM field. 

There is a quote somewhere about how if one could just understand this one thing: the electron coupled to the EM feld, then one would understand all the essential mysteries of quantum physics.
