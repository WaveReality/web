The **uncertainty principle** articulated by Werner Heisenberg is a basic property of any [[wave]], under the [[Hamiltonian]] interpretation of the wave properties in terms of _momentum_ and _position_ operators.

![Relationship between frequency and speed in the Klein-Gordon (KG) wave function, which derives from competition between the "mass drag" and the overall curvature of the wave. Higher frequency waves have more curvature and thus move faster.](media/fig_kg_freq_speed.png)

Specifically the property of a wave function that corresponds to _momentum_ is proportional to the _frequency_ of the wave ([[#figure_frequency]]), while more precisely encoding the position depends on having most of the wave amplitude concentrated into a narrow region of space.

These two properties are **complementary** (**canonically conjugate**), because frequency is only precisely well defined for an infinite sine wave, and becomes increasingly imprecise as the wave amplitude is concentrated into a narrow range of locations. But the converse is true for position, as noted above. So as you improve the quality of the momentum encoding in a wave, it necessarily degrades the position information, and vice-versa.

This can be expressed in the following inequality:

{id="eq_uncertainty" title="Uncertainty inequality"}
$$
\sigma_x \sigma_p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}
$$

Where $\sigma_x$ is the uncertainty (standard deviation) of position, and $\sigma_p$ is the uncertainty in momentum, and the best-case scenario is that the are equal to the reduced Plank constant $\hbar$ over 2. As one goes down, the other must go up to maintain this relationship.
