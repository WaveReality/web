![The double-slit experiment. Narrow openings in the slits cause the wave to spread through diffraction, and because of the different distances traveled in the path from the two different slits to a given point on the far screen P, the waves will experience either constructive or destructive interference, resulting in the wavy bands of light and dark as shown. The quantum paradox here is that this pattern obtains even when a _single particle_ is emitted at a time. The particle only ever goes through _one_ slit or the other, but somehow the wave goes through both. Figure from wikimedia commons by Lacatosias.](media/fig_double_slit_expt.png)

![Results of a double-slit experiment using electrons, with increasing numbers of electrons recorded (11, 200, 6,000, 40,000, and 140,000). The interference pattern emerges over time, even though only single electrons are detected on each trial.

The **double-slit** experiment (also known as Young's experiment) ([[#figure_double-slit]]), is said to illustrate the full mystery of quantum mechanics, and nicely demonstrates some puzzling aspects of wave-particle duality. Interestingly, the double slit experiment was around long before quantum mechanics, as a way of generating interference patterns with waves, but it "just got weird" when the intensity of the light, or beam of electrons or other particles, is reduced to the point where there is only a _single particle_ passing through the apparatus at a time.

Surprisingly, one still observes the interference effect in this case ([[#figure_double-slit-elec]]). How can a single "hard little particle", all by itself, produce this wave-like interference effect?  There are _many_ other results that all add up to the strong conclusion that, somehow, elementary particles like electrons have _both_ wave and particle properties.

The [[pilot-wave]] framework of de Broglie and Bohm provides the most natural, intuitive explanation of these effects: the wave goes through both slits, and the particle goes through one, but it is influenced by the wave.
